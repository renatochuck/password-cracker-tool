## Introduction
This tool demonstrates the use of different password-cracking techniques for educational purposes. It allows you to crack hashes using brute force, dictionary-based attacks, and GPU acceleration. It's a great project to learn about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and hash algorithms.

## Features
- **Brute-force attack**: Tries all possible combinations of characters to crack the password.
- **Dictionary attack**: Uses a predefined wordlist to attempt to guess the password.
- **GPU-accelerated attack**: Uses Hashcat to leverage GPU for faster cracking.
- **Distributed cracking**: Allows multiple clients to work together on cracking a password hash.

## Installation
### 1. Install Python Dependencies
This tool is written in Python, so you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Hashcat (for GPU mode)
If you plan to use the **GPU mode** for faster cracking, you'll need to install [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/). Follow the instructions on the website to install Hashcat on your system.

### 3. Clone the Repository
You can clone the repository to your local machine using Git. In your terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/password-cracker.git
cd password-cracker
```

## Usage
Once you have cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, you can run the script with different modes:

### Syntax
```bash
python3 password_cracker.py <hash_to_crack> --mode <mode> --algorithm <algorithm>
```

### Example Commands:
- **Brute-force attack (MD5 hash)**:
  ```bash
  python3 password_cracker.py 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 --mode brute --algorithm md5
  ```
- **Dictionary attack (using a wordlist)**:
  ```bash
  python3 password_cracker.py <hash> --mode dictionary --algorithm sha256 --wordlist /path/to/wordlist.txt
  ```
- **GPU acceleration (Hashcat)**:
  ```bash
  python3 password_cracker.py <hash> --mode gpu --algorithm bcrypt
  ```
- **Distributed cracking (starting a server)**:
  ```bash
  python3 password_cracker.py <hash> --mode distributed
  ```

### Arguments:
- `--hash_to_crack`: The password hash you want to crack.
- `--mode`: Choose one of the cracking modes: `brute`, `dictionary`, `gpu`, or `distributed`.
- `--algorithm`: Choose the hash algorithm (e.g., `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `bcrypt`).
- `--wordlist`: Path to the wordlist file for dictionary mode.
- `--max_length`: Max password length for brute-force mode (default is 8).
- `--port`: Port for the distributed cracking server (default is 9999).

## Educational Purpose
This project is designed to help you learn about **password cracking**, **hashing algorithms**, and **ethical hacking**. By using this tool, you'll better understand:
- How password hashes are generated and how attackers crack them.
- The difference between brute-force attacks and dictionary-based attacks.
- How powerful hardware (GPUs) can speed up the cracking process.
- How distributed systems can be used for cracking passwords in parallel.

### Please Note:
This tool should **ONLY** be used in ethical hacking scenarios, such as for **learning purposes** or to crack passwords for systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of password-cracking tools is illegal and unethical.
